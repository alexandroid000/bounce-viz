# visualize:

# for given theta, dP x dP and label as stable or unstable (color code regions
# of stability)

# highlight sections of boundary that are contracting for a specific angle theta
# slide theta and watch sections change - when do critical events happen? How
# many angles do we need to "cover" the polygon?
